Gervase struggled with depression twice in her life — both dealt with life and death.
The first time was after her brother died, and the second was after she gave birth to a child, who is now 14 months old. Her brother’s death resonated with her entire family, but it really hit her hard. It was a sign that everything doesn’t last forever, she said.
“The death of my brother changed how I prioritized people and events moving forward," Gervase wrote in a blog post. "I skimmed the fat from my life and made peace with my own demons."
Then, she met Kevin, and the two had a child in 2013 — Aria Rose. Her daughter's birth also spawned depression for Gervase. It wasn’t so much having a daughter that made her depressed, but rather her having to re-evaluate who she was as a person. She could no longer be the partier she once was. She had to be responsible.
But soon, little Aria helped Gervase rise up and overcome her depression.
“Aria is my compass,” Gervase said in her blog post. “My ‘why.’ She is the reason I quit my sales job in February 2014 and went full time as a life coach. My intuition would not be quieted. And I deeply respect that little voice. My life's experiences have taught me a powerful lesson about the undervalued strength to be found in our raw human connections our relationships.”
She also told Deseret News National that yoga helped her overcome her struggles, too: “Outside exercise is really the secret key to battling depression, as it gets endorphins pumping, which are needed,” she said.

Kate MacHugh is now 25. She’s an author and clinician.
But she only got to where she is now by overcoming depression as a teenager.
MacHugh said she was “harassed, humiliated and cyberbullied,” during her teenage years, leading her to go from being a happy and vibrant youngster to someone more angry and “sullen.” Once she became a different person, she slowly slipped into the murky waters of depression.
“It was the lowest I have ever felt in my life," she said to the National.
But everything changed once she went to college. The peers who had put her down and bullied her within the walls of high school were long gone, and she could finally start focusing on what made her unique and special. Instilling confidence in herself was what got her past depression and on a path to success, she said.
“I worked really hard to change the messages in my head,” MacHugh said. “I was led to believe that I was ugly, worthless, and disgusting. I internalized these messages and they became part of my identity. I began to tell myself that I was smart, loved and beautiful."
